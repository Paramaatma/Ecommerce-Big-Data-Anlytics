# Project Title: E-commerce Sales Analysis Using Hive
The purpose of this project is to analyze the sales data of an e-commerce company and gain insights about customer behavior, product trends, and sales performance. This project uses Hive, a data warehousing tool that enables easy querying and analysis of large datasets stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

Data Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from a real-life e-commerce company and contains information about sales transactions, customer demographics, product details, and order status. The dataset is in CSV format and is stored in HDFS.

Project Tasks
The following tasks are performed in this project:

Data Exploration: Explore the dataset and identify the relevant tables and fields for analysis.

Data Cleaning: Clean the data and transform it into a structured format suitable for analysis.

Data Modeling: Create the necessary tables and load the data into Hive tables.

Data Analysis: Perform queries to gain insights about customer behavior, product trends, and sales performance.

Data Visualization: Visualize the insights using tools like Excel, Tableau, or other visualization tools.

Tools Used
The following tools are used for this project:

Hive: A data warehousing tool that enables querying and analysis of large datasets stored in HDFS.

HDFS: Hadoop Distributed File System, a distributed file system that stores data across multiple servers.

Excel/Tableau: Visualization tools used to create charts and graphs.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Hive can be used to analyze large datasets and gain valuable insights about customer behavior, product trends, and sales performance. The insights gained from this analysis can be used by the e-commerce company to improve their sales and marketing strategies, identify new business opportunities, and optimize their operations.
